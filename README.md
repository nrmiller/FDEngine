## About FDEngine

FDEngine is a general-purpose game engine built on top of LWJGL, and uses a Plugin-Oriented Entity Component System architecture.

Entity Component System is a fairly common choice for game architectures as it solves the traditional diamond dependency problem in a clean manner. A unique feature of this game engine is that in addition to providing an ECS architecture, it is also plugin-oriented.

What this means is that developers can modify the systems to work in a way that suits their needs best.
